# Technique Overview

    This page is started with Larry's post on Facebook and now is flushed out in a more easily read format. Enjoy!
    
## Dialing In
Dialing in the proper grind of your coffee is the step which takes the most time yet it is inherently the most important step. While normal steam-based espresso machines run about a 25-35 seconds per shot you generally want 1.2 to 1.3x that time.   One should shoot for 40 to 55 seconds for a pull at the beginning. If your shot runs faster, grind your coffee finer. Vice-versa,  if slower then grind coarser. It may take a few days and multiple shots to get your first perfectly timed pull. 

If you hit this step and your espresso still does not taste the way you perceive it should, please review below:

## Pulling
For your first few shots as you dial in your new Flair: 
When you begin to pull your shot, perform a 10 second hold around 2-3 bar to pre-wet the coffee grinds. Wait for a “drop” to fall into your vessel and slightly release pressure to that 2-3 then begin the timed count. Generally , the times of this pre-infuse are 10-20 seconds (as you prefer) before starting your timed shot and slow-pulling to the 7-9 bar. Extraction begins when the coffee leaves the portafilter, therefore start your timer when you begin pulling to pressure and drops fall. That will be your timed shot.

Alternately you can slowly ramp up to your desired pressure in the 7-9 bar range over the first 15 seconds of pulling your shot. Still, I highly recommend the pre-infuse method until you are used to dialing in shots on the Flair as it assists greatly in removing user error at the beginning!
If the bottomless portafilter spurts or sprays as you begin to learn, I recommend using the spout over it. Ignore it for now. Do not worry about pretty bottomless shots until you get a proper espresso with proper taste or flavors.  Seriously- stop worrying about a pretty shot until it tastes proper. Consider bottomless shots as an advanced technique for now; you will perfect these in time just by experience.
Again, taste is foremost! Then, worry about the rest. Stop: again, IF THE TASTE IS GOOD YOU DID IT RIGHT. DON'T FIX SOMETHING NOT BROKEN.
Freshness
It is my opinion that most sour shots are due to the coffee used. You do need fresh coffee from a roaster with a roast time within 4 weeks of your desired time of use. I find best espresso to be from two to six weeks off roast. Fresh coffee needs to rest about 10-14 days for best espresso! I found the most beautiful shots (from a visual and smell experience) come from beans within days off roast, yet they taste sour or bitter. Do not try to rush this time. If your fresh roast sucks in taste, then let it rest another five days before attempting again. 

Vice-versa, if the roast is over two months old you will most likely have very little crema, perhaps a decent taste, or some “stale peanut” type flavors. 

Crema is simply bits of coffee trapped within CO2 from the pressure and bloom release from the hot water. (More or less, this is my simplistic definition) Old coffee will give very little crema, new coffee will give too much (yes!). Remember, the “bloom” of off-gassing CO2 in coffee often lends to off-flavors which is why the resting period is important.

## Water
Water is everything. Since this is the vehicle of your coffee it is obvious-- if you have bad water, you will have bad coffee. When I lived in Kentucky,  we had hard limestone water. This is great for making bourbon but not for coffee. I used a Brita filter, then poured into my kettle. This helped greatly with the quality of my brews. I live in Virgina now, and the water is sweet and soft.  Now, my shots are even easier to pull and are more successful: I went from 7 out of 10 shots being great, 2 decent on my palate, and 1 “bleh” (being poured into the sink), to 9/10 being awesome and only one being terrible on occasion.

## Beans
Pick one coffee: one coffee, just one blend or roast, and get a few pounds of it. Do NOT change your coffee until you have this one dialed in. The problem with most first-time users is they buy 3 different espresso roasts and try to pull a shot from each one all at once (we all were equally excitable!). It all sucks, right? 

Remember, each roast requires a different grindsize, sometimes different temperature, different optimum pulling times, etc..... Too many variables to adequately dial-in when beginning. One type will eliminate most of this error!

My favorites to pull good shots when learning: 

- Peace Coffee's "Tree Hugger" (dark-ish roast): almost traditional espresso, syrupy, with very large sweet spot!
- Black and White coffee "The Classic" (medium-ish): toasted nut and chocolate flavors, takes a little dialing in but easy to get good flavor. Also recommended to those who think espresso is too dark and thick- this one hits a wider range of palettes. 
- Black and White coffee, “The Natural”: a light-medium Ethopian style blend. Lends towards light floral notes, but still traditional easy to dial in. For those wanting to go toward light roasts, this is your gateway.

Get started through the above. I'd start with Peace Coffee's then work my way through the others as you will learn how to dial in a range of roasts that are very forgiving and are known to taste great. 

DO NOT START WITH LIGHT ROASTS OR SINGLE ORIGINS as they are notoriously difficult to dial in because the "sweet spot" is so very small. They require near perfect controls as well. It is best to save these until you obtain the ability to pull repeatably good shots. 
 
## Ratio
Start with 1:2 ratio and move higher or lower depending on the bean and your preferences; this is standard in the espresso world. This means for every 1g of coffee put into the portafilter, you pull 2g of espresso. For the Flair Pro2, I prefer 18g in my portafilter and 36g out!
Also, for example: I liked the Peace Coffee “Tree Hugger” blend a bit stronger (18g in around 34g out) and the B/W Coffee “The Classic” about 38 to 40g out. Play with those ratios once you perfect everything above this section.
Here, as you learn, If you drink espresso straight and it "kinda" sucks:  Add 2 parts minimum hot water to it to make an Americano and it generally is perfect. Or add 2-4 ounces of scalded milk. You'll pick up how the “strong acidic” taste in the espresso mellows to a delicious cup - or understand how some flavors are better concentrated or watered down. I feel this is HUGE in learning to properly judge and taste espresso! Even now as I pull a shot, I will drink ⅔ of it straight, then add a portion of hot water to the remaining ⅓ to make a mini-Americano. It still trains my palette to new roasts and blends!

## Preheating
Lastly, heat is the second everything: Without good temperature control you will have off-flavors. By it's nature, Flair does not have temperature controls and quickly cools your temps. Develop a process to minimize this element!
 I boil my cylinder in a kettle. I have my puck/portafilter ready to go, mounted on the Flair. As soon as my kettle "clicks" to auto-off as it boils-→ I immediately remove the cylinder, place it on the portafilter setup, and fill it (often with still-bubbling water) from the kettle, then place the pressure gauge and start the slow ramp pull or pre-infusion. Do not worry about “too hot” as I have measured only around 190 to 195F in the cylinder at this stage depending on time of year. This is ideal! 

REMEMBER: Heat disperses quickly so keep it moving or you might get a sour shot.
Last Thoughts
The only tool I recommend is the WDT (the small whisk) to stir/break up your grinds uniformly. Use a small scale to accurately dial in your ratios. Everything else should be included in your kit!

There are some folks whom look at their puck POST shot to see if it channels and how dry it is for clues on improving. To me, this overly-complicates things, especially if you stop your shot short with water still within your Flair's cylinder. Example: Pull a 36g shot, there's still about 20g of water left in the chamber, therefore your puck will be muddy! Ignore this and focus on taste of the shot!
Good luck. The rest of it is all practice and experience!
