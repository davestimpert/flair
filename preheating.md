# Preheating

Preheating the cylinder on your Flair Espresso machine is often the most overlooked step in the process, especially by new Flair owners. There are many ways to preheat your cylinder. Choose the one that best suits your equipment and workflow preference.

## Steam
Steam preheating is arguably the most popular preheat method. One method involves setting a silicone funnel on top of an electric kettle, and allowing the steam from the boiling water in the kettle to preheat the cylinder. This method is simple, effective, and keeps the outside of the cylinder dry. Alternatively, some have found that the opening of the base chamber of some moka pots is the right size to allow the chamber to sit down inside just slightly. If the moka pot base is filled with water and then placed on the stove it can also be used to preheat the Flair chamber this way.

## Submerge
Depending on the vessel used to boil your water, you can set your cylinder in the boiling water. This technique provides sufficient heat, but may be more tricky to manage than steam. You might need to use tongs to fetch the cylinder out of the water

## Fill
You can fill your cylinder with boiling water to preheat it. Note that you will need to fill and dump the water several times in order to reach the desired temperature.
