# Scales

It is possible to brew good espresso without a scale. However, having one will make it far easier to do so consistently and make the dial-in process less frustrating.

To make consistently good espresso, you should be weighing inputs (amount of coffee ground into the basket) and outputs (amount of espresso pressed into the cup). Measuring these volumetrically is not consistent:

- Different beans have different densities. Coffee beans are an organic product, and the actual amount of coffee you get from a given volume will be a combination of the growing conditions, cultivar, roast level, bean size, and countless other factors.
- Crema. Crema is generated when Carbon Dioxide (CO2) that is dissolved into the espresso under pressure from brewing is released and trapped in bubbles formed by compounds in the coffee. Different beans generate different amounts of crema, and the same beans will generate less crema as they age and degas.

A cheap, $20 or less scale will suffice for most purposes, although more expensive scales will offer intangible benefits like logging, better build quality, or waterproofing. Features to look for include:

- .1-gram precision. Grams are a convenient unit to use, neither too large or too small to be impractical, and tenths of grams are generally sufficient for consistency.
- A small footprint. If the scale does not fit on the drip tray of the flair, you won't be able to use it to measure your outputs.
- Fast response time. A slow scale is frustrating to use, and you can easily miss your target weight if your scale is slow.
- A timer. Not strictly required -- you can use the timer on your phone. However, having it directly on the scale reduces the number of things you have to have out and look at.
- Consistency. Your scale should consistently tare out whatever you dose your beans into and consistently measure the weight of your beans. Some scales will drift over time or as their batteries run down, or may measure differently depending on the ambient temperature.

The scales listed below are ones people have had success with, although it is far from all-encompassing:
 
| Name	| Price	| Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brewista Smartscale II	| $90 |	Water resistant. Has automatic timer and tare modes. Uses a lithium-ion battery. Works best with a shim under the front edge, like rubber feet. |
| Acaia Lunar	| $225 |	Water resistant. Has automatic timer and tare modes. Uses a lithium-ion battery. Has a smartphone app. Comes with a heat resistant pad and calibration weight. Can measure to .01 grams. |
| Weightman Coffee Scale	| $12 |	Rebadged and sold under several different brands/names all around $10-$15, including Joefrex, Yagua, and Maxus. There is a version that comes with a silicon measuring bowl for $16. |
| Acaia | Pyxis/Cinco	| $250 |	A smaller version of the Lunar. Water resistant. Has automatic timer and tare modes. Uses a lithium-ion battery. Has a smartphone app. Comes with carrying case and calibration weight. Measures to .01 grams. The cinco was a limited edition product and predecessor to the Pyxis. |
| Anpress Digital-Kaffee-Skala	| â‚¬19	| Too large to fit under the base of the flair; needs to rest on the base. |
