# Grinders
Many people who are new to making espresso don't realize that the grinder is the most important piece of equipment you will buy. If you are going to skimp on something, DON'T skimp on your grinder!

The general consensus is that you will get better grind quality for your money by buying a manual grinder, but of course you'll have to put in a bit more effort to grind your coffee. Some people really enjoy the manual nature of producing espresso with a Flair and choose a manual grinder to go with it. Others just want their beans ground as quickly as possible and choose an electric grinder. All of the grinders listed on this page have been used to produce very high quality espresso using a Flair. Each has their advantages and disadvantages and you will likely be able to find loyal users of each.

We have included a list of super-premium grinders as examples, but it is in no way exhaustive. The ultimate coffee grinder can cost several thousand dollars (US). However, be aware that, once you are in the price range of the grinders on this page, there is a point of diminishing returns. Will a grinder that costs 5x more produce better espresso? Quite possibly. Will it produce espresso that is 5x better? No. 

There are many hundreds of coffee grinders on the market. What if you are interested in one (or already have one) that isn't on this list? Will it work? Here are a few requirements for a grinder to be useable for making espresso.

- Burrs - In order for a grinder to produce the consistent grind size that is necessary for making espresso, it must grind using burrs. Blade grinders simply won't work.
- Grind size range - In order to make espresso the coffee needs to be ground very fine - much finer than you would use for brewing a normal cup of coffee. (The exception to this is if you are using the pressurized portafilter that comes with the Flair Neo. It will allow you to use a coarser grind, although the espresso it produces is not quite as good). So, you need a grinder that can grind very fine.
- Adjustability - This is the one that many cheaper grinders don't have. To make good espresso on a regular basis you will need to be able to make tiny adjustments in the grind size. Many cheaper grinders have notches, or clicks, or “steps” that represent different grind size settings in their adjustment mechanism. You either need a grinder that has ~50+ notches, or a grinder that has no notches (or clicks) at all and allows you to make continuous (often called "stepless") adjustments.
- Consistency - Making espresso can become very frustrating if you can't count on your grinder to produce a certain grind size, consistently and repeatably, at a particular setting. This comes from quality engineering and manufacturing. Many cheaper grinders simply don't have this.

With coffee grinders, you generally do get what you pay for. A good rule of thumb (with a few exceptions) is that you need to spend $250+ for an electric grinder and $150+ for a manual grinder to get the kind of performance necessary for effective, and pleasurable, espresso-making. Happy brewing!

## Manual
 
| Name	| Price	| Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flair Royal	| $179 |	 |
| Lido E	| $195	| Same as Lido E-T, but with no foldable handle and slightly different accessories |
Lido E-T	$195	Same as Lido E, but with a foldable handle and slightly different accessories
Apollo Bplus	$280	Stepped.
Kinu M47 Classic	$329	The M47 Classic and Simplicity are effectively the same grinder, with the same internals. The Classic is the only M47 version with the "click feeling" system,  where there is a click at each mark on the adjustment wheel, making the M47 Classic a stepped grinder.
Kinu M47 Simplicity	$275	The M47 Classic and Simplicity are effectively the same grinder, with the same internals. The Simplicity replaces some trim with plastic (catch cup,  handle, and hopper funnel). It also lacks the "click feeling" system of the Classic.
Kinu M47 Phoenix	$199	The M47 Phoenix takes the Simplicity and replaces the internal bearing mounts with plastic instead of steel.
Comandante C40	$250	Stepped. Many report the steps on the C40 are too far apart to provide the adjustability required for espresso. The available "Red Clix" upgrade (~$40 - $50) adds an extra click between the original steps which should offer sufficient adjustability.
1ZPresso JX-Pro	$159	Stepped.
Option-O Remi	$230	A development of the Helor 101, with a magnetic grind catch and minor cosmetic differences. Offers "conventional burrs" ($200) that are meant for coarser brew methods and "Contemporary burrs" ($230) that are meant for espresso.
